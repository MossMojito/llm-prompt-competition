# 📓 Simplified Notebooks for DA Friends

**These notebooks are designed for Data Analysts with zero AI/engineering experience.**

## 🎯 What's Different from the Full Project?

| Full Project | Simplified Notebooks |
|--------------|---------------------|
| GitHub workflow | Just copy notebooks |
| Multiple files | 3 self-contained notebooks |
| Complex setup | Run cells sequentially |
| Advanced concepts | Basic, visual explanations |
| For engineers | For DAs/non-technical users |

- Load model and data
- Test that everything works

**Outcome**: Environment ready, basic understanding

---

### **Notebook 2: Learn Prompt Engineering** (20 minutes)
- See bad vs good prompts
- Learn 3 strategies:
  - Zero-shot (simple)
  - Few-shot (with examples)
  - Chain-of-thought (step-by-step)
- Compare results
- Experiment

**Outcome**: Know how to write effective prompts

---

### **Notebook 3: The Competition** (30 minutes)
- Create their best prompt
- Test on 100 reviews
- Get accuracy score
- See visualizations
- Compare to benchmarks

**Outcome**: Real competition score, understand their performance

## 🚀 How to Share with Your Friends

### **Option 1: Import to Databricks (Recommended)**

1. **Upload notebooks to Databricks**:
   - In Databricks, go to "Workspace"
   - Click "Import"
   - Upload all 3 `.py` files
   - They become notebooks automatically

2. **Share the folder**:
   - Right-click folder → "Permissions"
   - Add your friends' emails
   - They get "Can Run" permission

3. **Tell them**: 
   - "Open Notebook 1"
   - "Click Run All"
   - "Follow along!"

---

### **Option 2: Copy for Each Person**

1. **You import once**
2. **Each friend**:
   - Right-click notebook → Clone
   - Name it "[Their Name]'s Competition"
   - They edit their own copy

**Advantage**: Everyone has their own workspace, no conflicts

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: "Package not found"**
**Solution**: Re-run the pip install cell and restart Python

### **Issue 2: "Model loading is slow"**
**Solution**: Normal! First load takes 3-5 minutes. Tell them to be patient.

### **Issue 3: "My accuracy is only 60%"**
**Solution**: That's part of learning! Encourage them to try different strategies.

### **Issue 4: "I don't understand the code"**
**Solution**: "You don't need to! Just focus on writing your prompt in Notebook 3."

---

## 🏆 Competition Setup

### **Individual Competition**:
Everyone competes independently, submit scores in a shared document

### **Team Competition**:
Groups of 2-3 work together, submit one prompt

### **Iterative Competition**:
- Round 1: Everyone submits
- Share top 3 strategies
- Round 2: Everyone tries to improve
- See who improved most

---

## 📊 Suggested Schedule

### **Week 1: Learning**
- Monday: Share notebooks, everyone does Notebook 1 & 2
- Wednesday: Q&A session
- Friday: Everyone tries Notebook 3 once

### **Week 2: Competition**
- Monday: Submit best prompts
- Wednesday: Reveal leaderboard
- Friday: Winners share strategies

## 🎯 Success Metrics

**Good indicators your teaching is working**:

✅ Friends complete all 3 notebooks
✅ They get scores between 70-90%
✅ They can explain why their prompt works
✅ They want to improve their score
✅ They see practical applications at work

**Not success**:
❌ They give up at Notebook 1
❌ They don't understand what they're doing
❌ They're just copy-pasting without learning

---

## 💡 Teaching Tips

1. **Start with the "Why"**: 
   - Show them ChatGPT examples first
   - Explain how better prompts = better results
   - Make it relevant to their work

2. **Encourage Experimentation**:
   - There's no "wrong" prompt (except maybe blank!)
   - Try different things
   - Learn from failures

3. **Make it Fun**:
   - Create a leaderboard
   - Small prizes for top 3
   - Celebrate improvements

4. **Connect to Real Work**:
   - "How could you use this for customer analysis?"
   - "What prompts do you use at work?"
   - "How can you improve them?"
